<h3>About</h3>
<p>
I'm not an expert.  In fact, I'm a bit of a rookie.  Just over a year ago, I decided to start learning how to write code.  I have always had an interest in technology, as well as ideas that I have wanted to implement, but lacked the knowledge to actually create anything.  Prior to this, my knowledge of programming was limited to writing a spreadsheet sum function.  After about a year of research and learning on my own, using free resources, I have decided to blog my education and attempts at writing code here, to record my progress as well as for use by anyone who may be on similar path.

I am a big proponent of learning by doing, so I will mostly be working on projects and hopefully picking up the necessary skills along the way.  My first goal is to create the blog that you are currently reading.  I have decided to create the blog using Mongo DB, Angular, Express, and Node.js, a.k.a. the MEAN stack.  Well, that is what I want the finished product to look like anyway, but I want to get it up and running asap, so I'll start with a basic webpage and build it up as I go along.
